This region extends from Michigan south to Kansas, northern Oklahoma, and Texas, and accounts for the majority of America’s grain production. Bisected with irrigation ditches into geometric fields, the abstract grid of the landscape looks from above like a work of modern art." .

In Hispanic and Chicano culture, customized cars called \"lowriders\" have special meaning. Designed to cruise low and slow, lowriders sport spectacular paint jobs and handcrafted interiors. Luis Tapia’s <em>Spanish Colonial Carreta</em> exudes the blend of popular and religious imagery that is at the heart of contemporary Hispanic art, as well as the individualized nature of both lowriders and <em>santos</em> as art forms. Emblazoned on the grill and steering wheel is a sacred heart, a symbol of the physical heart of Christ and his love, compassion, and suffering. Other symbols include the priest's chairs for bucket seats and the vigas, or traditional beams used in adobe architecture, for bumpers." .

Influenced by the Navajo emphasis on harmony with nature, Whitehorse explores her native landscape through abstract marks that represent symbols, plants, and events to create a mental experience of land. This emphasis on the relationship between the artist and the land speaks to the intimate familiarity that many Native peoples have felt about their environment. As Whitehorse observed: <em>My paintings tell the story of knowing land over time—of being completely, micro-cosmically within a place . . . they are purposefully meditative and meant to be seen slowly. Their intricate language of symbols refers to specific plants, people, and experiences.</em>" .

Fascinated by the ritual dramas and spiritual life of Native and Hispanic culture since childhood, Paul Pletka's work exudes the dynamic tension that can occur when state-sponsored religion is imposed upon Indigenous peoples. This is the case with <em>Tears of the Lord</em>, in which the figure of Christ, his flesh wooden and peeling as if a devotional sculpture, is shown nailed to an Aztec cross. At his feet a group of Mexican people wear a combination of traditional and contemporary dress, which in turn reflects both Indigenous and Western designs. Their disregard for the image of suffering taking place in their midst suggests the ambivalence that European beliefs are sometimes met with in Native societies." .

These figures, called santos (religious carvings depicting saints) or bultos (saints carved in the round), often feature solid bases and elongated forms so they can be raised and seen from high. Some of the earliest santos appear to be in the style of the Spanish baroque. In modern practice, santos are a sophisticated and vibrant art form." .

The distinctive color is a result of being fired in special outdoor pits, in which the iron in the local clay oxidizes, turning the pot a deep, rich black." .

Martinez was trained by her aunt in the traditional pottery methods, although she often hid her early creations away, convinced that their quality was not up to ancient standards. In 1909, she joined forces with Museum of New Mexico founder Edgar Lee Hewitt to create works for the museum. This encouragement launched her long career, during which she constantly experimented with new methods of firing and glazing." .

Imported from Spain, images of saints became the basis of a new iconography that adorned both churches and private homes. The story of Saint Sebastian—who was tied to a stake and shot full of arrows for converting people to Christianity in ancient Rome—provided an example of devotion and suffering for the faithful. Alonso Cano was the \"most celebrated draughtsman among all Spanish painters\" who worked in seventeenth-century Spain. This painting formerly hung in the Southwest Museum’s Casa de Adobe—a re-creation of a nineteenth-century Californio home that opened as a tourist attraction in Los Angeles in 1916. The use of a Spanish religious painting in a historic setting was meant to evoke the cultural patrimony of California’s Spanish descendants." .

Wider-than-long banded blankets of this type are rare and are documented from Southwest archaeological sites dating to at least 1750. While the shape is derived from the Pueblo manta-style garment, the pattern is believed to be one of the oldest in the Navajo design repertoire and probably predates 1750, although no earlier examples are documented. The Navajo term <em>hanolchadi</em>, or carded wool, was recorded in 1910 by Father Bernard Haile to connote the chief-style blanket, which was commercially sold under this term by trader Juan Lorenzo Hubbell. The attribution of \"chief\" is a misnomer and has nothing to do with Navajo social structure. The blankets were thus named because the style was prized by Plains Indian leaders, or chiefs, who historically acquired them for their wives and daughters as status symbols." .

Known as the “soldier-artist of the frontier,” Seth Eastman composed on-location paintings as an attempt to preserve ordinary moments from Native American life. Like many of his artistic colleagues at mid-century, Eastman saw this as a world in decline; his art was thus part of a broader ethnographic impulse to document Native peoples before they succumbed to the corruptive influence of European society.   In <em>Indian on the Lookout</em>, Eastman uses a decaying tree as a metaphor for the deterioration of Native America. His military training gave him a keen command of topographical detail, and he often painted river views with imposed Indian figures. The figure is an accurate if somewhat generic image of a Native man, but the landscape is an imagined combination of Western topography, from canyons and meadows to rivers and mountains." .

In the remote outpost of Northern New Mexico, carved and painted figures of saints were called upon for help with rain, harvests, and other situations.   The political isolation and increasing wealth of northern New Mexico made for a unique and flourishing tradition of devotional art. This piece is attributed to the Arroyo Hondo santero (a maker of santos) who worked in the rural communities around Taos. Characterized by a simple elegance, his work has been described as “the most purely spiritualized sculpture of nineteenth-century New Mexico.” The piece also reflects the prominence of the Franciscan Order, which advocated the ideals of piety and charity." .

His painting <em>The Dead Miner</em> was designed to elicit maximum sympathy: depicted as a martyr to progress, the miner’s outstretched hand clasps a portrait of his sweetheart, and he has only his loyal hound to mourn him." .

Based on the composition of an 1882 illustration for <em>Harper's Weekly</em> titled \"A Pitching Bronco,\" the preliminary clay sculpture was completed in 1895 and copyrighted in October of that year.   The work, with horse and rider twisting upward through space in one fluid, serpentine movement, represents a break from the static formula used in most equine sculpture of Remington's day. An acknowledged metaphor for the taming of the West, the subject of a cowboy breaking an unruly horse was by far his most popular, suggested in the more than three hundred casts created during the artist's lifetime." .

    crm:P3_has_note "Painting by Thomas Moran, <em>Mountain of the Holy Cross</em>, 1875.  Few sites embodied romantic mystery and western legend more than did Colorado's Mountain of the Holy Cross. Prior to William Henry Jackson's 1873 photo (created during a government expedition led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden), the mountain was known primarily through folklore that traced its first sightings to Spanish explorers. Popularly believed to have been emblazoned on the mountain by the hand of God, the cross came to be seen as a call for Americans to renew the Christian morality required to settle the West. Mountain of the Holy Cross was thus seen as a New-World embodiment of the Old Testament site where God was revealed to Moses, and was quickly deemed an \"American Sinai.\" The mountain's role as an emblem of the religious call to Western settlement was enhanced by its position between the crucial 39<sup>th</sup> and 40<sup>th</sup> degrees of latitude, a location that Hayden had called public attention to in his annual report to Congress in 1873. Surrounded by mountains and linked with a river system, many saw Colorado Territory (which became a state within a year of Moran's painting) as the spiritual heart of the budding American Empire.   Upon seeing Jackson's photo, Moran traveled to the area the following summer, where he decided to use the waterfall in the foreground to emphasize the monumentality of the scene and bring it more in line with popular conventions regarding the picturesque. With this characteristic use of artistic license, Moran completed the painting in April of 1874 from his Newark studio, and by early June arranged for the picture to go on display at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.   Perhaps due to its overtly religious message, <em>Mountain of the Holy Cross</em> remained unsold for several years, until it was purchased in 1880 by Dr. William Bell, a founding member of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad consortium. Moran was market-savvy, and knew when he painted <em>Mountain of the Holy Cross</em> that the natural formation would be interpreted as divine favor for western expansion, a central tenet of European-American social and religious thought. Under his ownership, Bell took this symbolism one step further by selling tickets to see the painting to pilgrims visiting his home on their way to the mineral springs of the Rockies." .
